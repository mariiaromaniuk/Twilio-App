# Twilio Video Chat

This is an example video chat application built with Twilio Video and React. Twilio is a very powerful tool. This is a very simple sample app to showcase it's most basic capabilities, but it can be used for more complex needs. I'm currently working on: 
- Adding an option for user to share his or her screen, 
- Creating a live drawing-sharing feature, 
- Setting up a server to handle international calls with low latency, 
- Allowing a call admin to remove participants from the call, and many others. 

## Preparing the application

Start by cloning or downloading the repo. 

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Credentials

You will need your Twilio Account SID, an API key and secret, all of them available by seeting up a Twilio account. 

All of them should be added to the .env file.

## Running the application

Run the app with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will open in your browser at localhost:3000
